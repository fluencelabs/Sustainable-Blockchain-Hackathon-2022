# Sustainable Blockchain Hackathon 2022

[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is proud to support the [Sustainable Blockchain Virtual Hackathon](<[https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/sustainable/onboard](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/sustainable/onboard)>) organized by [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) June 23 - July 18, 2022, and we welcome you to join us in an exciting Web3 summer diversion!

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Resource discovery, e.g., FaaS, is achieved by function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models within the decentralized serverless paradigm.

## How to Participate

The hackathon has a variety of bounties you can approach via the Gitcoin platform. The participation and submission rules are available from the [event site](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/sustainable/onboard).

## Hacking With Fluence

The Fluence peer-to-peer compute protocol, aka decentralized serverless, allows you to create decentralized off-chain protocols and applications with ease. To get you going, you may want to look at Fluence and Aqua to

- decentralize centralized components, bottlenecks and choke-points in your existing IPFS or Filecoin DApp
- create decentralized peer-to-peer protocols to replace centralized off-chain solutions by means of decentralized off-chain oracles or by swapping centralized service providers, e.g., AWS Lambda, for a decentralized Fluence p2p infrastructure
- decentralize centralized off-chain solutions such as relayers for single- or multi-chain bridges
- enable dynamic NFTs by creating one or more decentralized off-chain oracles to provide (continuous) data feeds to your NFTs
- create decentralized off-chain curation capabilities to your registries and whitelists

## Hacking On Fluence

For a quick overview, see our [Hacking On Fluence](https://fluencenetwork.notion.site/Hacking-On-Fluence-Primer-28a87754397048e1bec72e3bfc91fd9b) document as well as the [examples](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples) repo.

A variety of [examples and tutorials](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples) are available including [evm-integration](<[TBD](https://github.com/fluencelabs/examples/tree/main/aqua-examples/evm-integration)>).

## Resources

Fluence has a variety of components and building blocks available to accelerate your project build.
